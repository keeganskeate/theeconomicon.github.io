				<!-- Introduction -->
					<p class="lettrine bottom-padded">
						During the past year, 30 medical cannabis patients in Hawaii have received a letter that 
						informs them that they are disqualified from possessing firearms and ammunition. 
						The letters further instruct the patients to either surrender any currently owned firearms, 
						permits, and ammunition to the Honolulu Police Department or to transfer ownership of the 
						firearms and ammunition. Ultimately, this may penalize medical cannabis patients that attempt 
						to adhere to the law. The law may have the unintended consequence of encouraging gun owners 
						to use illegal instead of medical cannabis. Similarly, medical cannabis patients may buy 
						illegal firearms that are not registered or sold from a licensed vendor. Meanwhile, medical 
						cannabis patients that attempt to adhere to the law bear the inconvenience of having their 
						rights restricted.
					</p>
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>The state of affairs of firearms and cannabis in Hawaii</h3>
					<p>
						In 2011, the <i>Associated Press</i> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44712648/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/do-medical-marijuana-users-have-right-bear-arms-no-says-atf/#.WiSZmEqnG00">reported</a> 
						that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives clarified that all cannabis users, 
						including state-sanctioned medical cannabis patients, are prohibited from possessing firearms. 
						Possession does not necessarily imply ownership, therefore, any firearm use is encompassed in the 
						law, making it federally illegal for any cannabis user to use a firearm in any circumstance. 
						Federal firearm licensees are responsible for inquiring if a purchaser is a controlled substance user. 
						Licensed dealers are prohibited from selling firearms and ammunition to anyone who presents a 
						reasonable suspicion of controlled substance use, including, but not limited to, buyers who present 
						medical cannabis recommendations as identification, buyers who talk about controlled substance use, 
						and buyers who have a recent controlled substance conviction.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						According to the <i>Associated Press</i>, already by September of 2011:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							The clash between state and federal drug laws has led to lawsuits and criminal cases in 
							some of the 16 states that have legalized medical marijuana use.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						In Oregon, the <i>Associated Press</i> detailed an Oregon Supreme Court ruling stating that sheriffs 
						could not deny concealed handgun licenses to medical cannabis patients, because the state firearm 
						laws, separate from federal firearm laws, do not address medical cannabis use. The ruling allows for 
						an avenue for cannabis users to acquire firearms, but does not change the federal legality for a 
						cannabis user to possess a firearm.
					</p>
					<p>
						The state attorney general of Montana, Steve Bullock, 
						<a href="https://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/100311_Holder-letter.pdf">responded</a> 
						to Attorney General Holder in a letter that acknowledged the supremacy of the federal government, 
						but referenced several conflicts with Montana's state constitution and respectfully requested the 
						Department of Justice to "not pursue any criminal prosecutions" against citizens that are abiding 
						by Montana state law.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						On August 31st, 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
						<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/court-upholds-ban-gun-sales-marijuana-card-holders-n640951">ruled</a> 
						that barring medical cannabis patients from possessing firearms does not violate the Second Amendment. 
						The unanimous decision concluded that cannabis "raises the risk of irrational or unpredictable 
						behavior with which gun use should not be associated."
					</p>
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>Motivation for the Hawaiian restriction</h3>
					<p>
						The Hawaiian restriction put in place in the past year disqualifying 
						<a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabis/files/2014/11/329-part-IX-as-of-07-2016.pdf">medical cannabis patients</a> 
						from possessing firearms and ammunition may have been instigated by a broadening of 
						<a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/58356/download">law enforcement authority</a> rather 
						than based on evidence-driven policy.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						<i>Leafly News</i> confirmed that 
						<a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/surrender-your-guns-police-tell-hawaiian-medical-marijuana-patients">letters addressed to medical cannabis patients</a>, 
						and signed by the Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard, informed patients:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							[Y]ou are disqualified from firearms ownership, possession or controlling firearms. 
							Your medical marijuana use disqualifies you from ownership of firearms and ammunition.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						The letter further stated:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							If you currently own or have any firearms, you have 30 days upon receipt of this letter to 
							voluntarily surrender your firearms, permit, and ammunition to the Honolulu Police Department 
							(HPD) or otherwise transfer ownership.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The letter sent by the Honolulu Police Department provided that 
						"[a] medical doctor's clearance letter is required for any future firearms applications or return of 
						firearms from HPD evidence." A <a href="http://www.civilbeat.org/2017/11/honolulu-police-tell-medical-marijuana-patients-to-give-up-their-guns/">report</a> 
						by Hawaii's state attorney general further stipulates that medical cannabis patients can only 
						successfully apply for a firearm permit after their medical cannabis card have been expired for one year.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						Furthermore, an electronic database of medical cannabis patients and a firearms registry allowed the 
						Honolulu Police Department to compile a list of people who may be in violation of state law and who 
						are in violation of federal law. Seemingly without knowing, the police department created a list and 
						requested evidence from people who could be charged with the federal offense of possession of a 
						firearm or ammunition by a prohibited person. Anyone who tests positive for cannabis, possesses 
						cannabis, or possesses cannabis paraphernalia, such as a medical cannabis card or recommendation, 
						is a prohibited person. 
						<a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/guncard.pdf">The charge</a>, 
						under 18 USC &sect; 922(g) & (n), is punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison. It is worrying 
						that seized firearms and ammunition are inventoried by the Honolulu Police Department as evidence. 
						If a medical cannabis patient that currently owns a firearm submits their firearms to the police, 
						then their firearm could be used as evidence for charging the patient with a federal offense.
					</p>
					
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>The Federalism Dilemma</h3>
					<p>
						Federalism, the allocation of rights between the federal and state governments, protects the 
						federal and state governments from encroaching on each others' sovereignty. Presently, there is a 
						major federalism dilemma with having cannabis both federally prohibited and state-legalized.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/801">Controlled Substance Act</a> (CSA) 
						designates cannabis as a Schedule &#8544; drug, on the basis that there is no recognized medical use 
						for cannabis, therefore, possession, distribution, and cultivation of cannabis is illegal. The Supreme 
						Court confirmed in the 2001 case <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-151.ZS.html"><i>United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative</i></a> 
						that state exceptions for medical cannabis do not supersede the Controlled Substance Act's prohibition 
						of cannabis. Justice Thomas remarked in his opinion that "Congress has made a determination that 
						marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception." Therefore, legal use of cannabis for 
						medicinal purposes will ultimately need to be decided and acted upon by Congress. It should also be 
						noted that in Justice Thomas's opinion he stated that "the statute consistently treats all 
						schedule &#8544; drugs alike." An interpretation of his opinion may suggest that there is no apparent 
						difference between operating or frequenting a cannabis dispensary and operating or frequenting a 
						heroin or methamphetamine dispensary. Consequently, medical cannabis patients will be held in the 
						same light as hard drug users and dealers by the courts until Congress passes an act to the contrary.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						The 2005 decision of <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/545/1.html"><i>Gonzales v. Raich</i></a> 
						by the Supreme Court ruled:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							Congress' Commerce Clause authority includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and 
							use of marijuana in compliance with California law.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						Relying on principles of federalism, Justice Stevens wrote:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and 
							state law, federal law shall prevail.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						In his <a href="http://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/fiulawr11&section=23">scholarly research</a>, 
						Brannon P. Denning, Associate Dean and Professor of Law at Samford University, remarked:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							[S]tates that have legalized marijuana have inadvertently exposed some of their citizens to 
							prosecution for federal firearms offenses that can carry hefty prison terms.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The professor notes that state legalization efforts are not prohibited by the Controlled Substance Act, 
						but state residents cannot legally engage in cannabis-related activities permitted by their state. 
						Due to state sovereignty, the federal government cannot force state law enforcement to enforce 
						federal laws. However, the federal government can still enforce the Controlled Substance Act in 
						states that have legalized cannabis with its own law enforcement agencies and Justice Department prosecutors.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						Another important case was a 
						<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/144orig_6479.pdf">recent lawsuit</a> 
						by the states of Nebraska and Oklahoma against Colorado, which borders both states. Lawyers for 
						Nebraska and Oklahoma argued that Colorado's permission of cannabis "increased trafficking and 
						transportation of Colorado-sourced marijuana" into their states, causing a strain on the states' 
						law enforcement departments, judicial systems, and penal system resources. The Supreme Court denied to 
						hear Nebraska and Oklahoma's complaint, without explanation. However, dissenting Justice Thomas wrote 
						that "[t]he plaintiff States have alleged significant harms to their sovereign interests caused by 
						another State. Whatever the merit of the plaintiff States' claims, we should let this complaint 
						proceed further rather than denying leave without so much as a word of explanation." Although the 
						Supreme Court dismissed this case, likely because the Court cannot commandeer Colorado's state 
						legislature to recriminalize cannabis, Justice Thomas's comments foreshadow a future interstate suit 
						regarding cannabis distribution and cross-border externalities.
					</p>
					
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>Arguments for and against firearm restrictions</h3>
					<p>
						In addition to desiring to own a firearm for personal preference or for a hobby, medical cannabis 
						patients and employees may wish to own a firearm because the prevalence of cash transactions in the 
						cannabis industry increases the likelihood of being a victim of an armed robbery. Washington State 
						has made it clear that their state laws do not prohibit firearm possession by licensed cannabis 
						businesses with Attorney General Bob Ferguson's 
						<a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3219329/PDF-White-Paper-Access-to-Firearms-in-Washington.pdf">statement</a> 
						that "licensees handle a high-value product on a largely cash basis (due to federal banking 
						restrictions) and, therefore, may be armed for self-protection. Nothing in state law prohibits 
						firearms possession by marijuana licensees."
					</p>
					<p>
						However, due to the federal illegality of cannabis, cannabis business employees that carry firearms 
						are in violation of federal law that bars the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of 
						cannabis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The federal government is particularly concerned about cannabis businesses being used as vehicles for 
						money laundering, because of the predominance of cash transactions. In addition, armed personnel at 
						cannabis business heighten the government's suspicion of organized crime operations. However, armed 
						security guards are often necessary and mandated to protect cannabis dispensaries. This presents a 
						dilemma where the safety provided by armed security at cannabis businesses is either impeded by the 
						incongruous federal classification of cannabis or illegal.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						Also, it may be inadvisable for medical cannabis patients to own, possess, or control firearms if 
						there is evidence that medical cannabis patients face a higher risk of suicide or are significantly 
						and substantially more likely to cause harm to others with firearms. Current 
						<a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/00952990.2014.910520">scientific evidence</a> 
						does not support a relationship between medical cannabis use and suicide. Major factors that are 
						significantly correlated with suicide are anxiety, depression, stress, and unemployment. Medical 
						cannabis may help to alleviate anxiety, depression, and stress, and cannabis legalization provides 
						job opportunities for unemployed workers. Therefore, it may actually be the case that cannabis helps 
						to treat conditions that lead to suicide. However, it is still an open debate as to whether cannabis 
						users are irrational and excessively prone to firearm accidents.
					</p>
					
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>Resonse to the restriction</h3>
					<p>
						Hawaii permitted medical cannabis as early as 2000, but the 
						<a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/first-medical-cannabis-dispensary-opening-hawaii">first cannabis dispensary in Hawaii</a> 
						did not open until August 8th, 2017. The actions taken by law enforcement are likely in response to 
						the recent introduction of medical cannabis on the islands. However, many citizens are clearly 
						incensed by law enforcement obstructions and there could be adverse and unintended effects from 
						Hawaii's latest effort to regulate firearms for medical cannabis patients.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Colorado, the Department of Health 
						<a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/00952990.2014.910520">speculated</a> that there may have been in a 
						decline in medical cannabis registrants in late 2011 partially due to "concerns that the 
						confidentiality of the registry was compromised and might affect employment or the ability to 
						purchase firearms or ammunition." If Hawaii loses the confidence of its citizens to not abuse the 
						medical cannabis patient database and continues to allow law enforcement to use the database at 
						their discretion, then more Hawaiian citizens will choose to use illegal cannabis instead of 
						state-licensed medical cannabis. A rise in illegal cannabis use may offset the intended benefits 
						of Hawaii's firearm restriction for medical cannabis patients.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						Hawaii is effectively ignoring federal drug scheduling to permit medical cannabis use and 
						distribution while relying on the same federal drug scheduling to deny patients permits for firearms. 
						A <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/did-honolulu-police-break-law-with-surrender-your-guns-letter">Honolulu physician</a>, 
						Dr. Clifton Otto, who is certified to prescribe cannabis to patients, told <i>Leafly News</i>:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							It's causing a bit of an uproar with our patients. We have a lot of patients, especially 
							those on the Big Island, who are hunters, and a fair number of them own firearms.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The doctor suggested that the problem may have begun when the Department of Health appended a 
						regulation regarding confidential health information in October of 2016. Originally, the regulation 
						allowed federal, state, and local law enforcement to access medical records solely for verifying 
						registration. The appendage to a clause in the regulation allows law enforcement to access medical 
						records, including medical cannabis patient registries, for any official law enforcement purpose. 
						The Honolulu Police Department appears to have interpreted the change in the Department of Health 
						regulation to justify crosschecking firearm permit applicants with Hawaii's medical cannabis patient 
						database to deny medical cannabis patients firearm permits.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						According to the <i>Honolulu Civil Beat</i>:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							From 2013 to 2016, 67 patients were denied gun permits, and the 
							[Honolulu Police Department] HPD has sent letters to 30 patients in the last year.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The Honolulu Star <a href="">confirmed</a> that "police have been sending the letters since at least 
						January" of 2017. It has been common practice for the Honolulu Police Department to deny cannabis 
						patients firearm permits, however, the new development is that the police department is now taking 
						active steps to urge firearm-owning medical cannabis patients to surrender their firearms. The 
						escalation by law enforcement may give rise to concerns that the Honolulu Police Department may 
						launch efforts to confiscate and seize firearms, or target new avenues to crack down on 
						state-permitted medical cannabis patients and businesses.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						<a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/business/health-care/article187722798.html">According</a> 
						to the Associated Press, "the notices sparked backlash from residents, prompting the police review." 
						Having sparked local and national outcry, the Honolulu Police Department may have started to 
						<a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/36963985/hpd-reviewing-policy-that-orders-prescription-pot-card-owners-to-turn-in-firearms-within-a-month">reconsider its deceleration</a> 
						as ill-advised. On December 5th, <i>Hawaii News Now</i> reported:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="no-padding">
							&ldquo;
							The Honolulu Police Department said they're consulting with other government agencies on a 
							policy that requires some medical marijuana card holders to turn in their firearms and 
							ammunition within 30 days after being instructed to do so by the agency.
							&rdquo;
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="bottom-padded">
						The Honolulu Police Department Chief, Susan Bullard, stated that the police department will not 
						require medical cannabis patients to surrender their firearms while the policy is being reviewed. 
						The outrage from medical cannabis patients and advocates may have forced Hawaii to backpedal its 
						escalation of firearm enforcement, demonstrating the ability of cannabis advocates to mobilize and 
						actualize change.
					</p>
					
				<!-- Section -->
					<h3>The incongruities are here for now</h3>
					<p>
						The inconsistencies with federally prohibited and state-legalized medical cannabis will continue to 
						plague U.S. residents for the foreseeable future, and Hawaii is no exception. Grappling with the 
						dilemma of ensuring both the rights of medical cannabis patients and public safety, Hawaii's 
						attempt to regulate firearms is the latest example of how Congress's inaction to reclassify cannabis 
						as a drug with recognized medicinal purposes is causing harm and uncertainty to thousands of 
						state-law abiding citizens. Moving forward, it will be of great interest to participants in and 
						advocates of the cannabis industry as to whether or not Congress will act so that state laws 
						regulating cannabis will gain teeth. Until then, Hawaii, and every other state that has legalized 
						cannabis, will continue to face legal hurdles in legislating a safe industry.
